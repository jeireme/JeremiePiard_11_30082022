## General informations

SportSee App is a sports coaching website that presents several graphics to support its users with personal data. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and works with a local API.

### Technologies

- [NodeJS (**version 16.17.0**)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## 1. Install the local API

First, follow the steps to install the local API you can find [here](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard).

Note: if the API isn't launched while the app is working, some mocked data will be used instead.

## 2. Launch the SportSee App

In order to make the app works, you'll need to clone this repository on your computer, install the dependencies and run the server:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jeireme/JeremiePiard_12_30082022
